#  Clima: Weather App

Clima is an application designed to provide weather information quickly and user-friendly. As a student who has just completed their first project, I'd like to share with you some features of my application and the concepts I applied during this process.

## Key Features:

### Dark Mode Support:
Clima offers the option to enable dark mode, providing users with a comfortable experience without straining their eyes.

### Live Weather Data:
The app retrieves live weather data from the internet, ensuring users always have access to up-to-date information.

### Current Location Weather:
Leveraging Core Location to access the GPS data of the device, Clima instantly provides weather information for the user's current location.

### Manual City Search:
Users can manually search for weather information in any city, allowing for better management of travel plans.

## Applied Concepts:

### Dark Mode Implementation:
Methods for enabling dark mode in the application were applied, enhancing the user experience.

### Usage of Vector Images:
Implementation of vector images in the application design was applied, introducing a more flexible and scalable design approach.

### UITextField and Delegate Pattern:
Usage of UITextField for user input and implementation of the delegate pattern were applied, resulting in more effective user interaction.

### Swift Protocols and Extensions:
Swift protocols and extensions were applied for better code organization and extensibility.

### Swift Guard Keyword:
The Swift guard keyword was applied for error management, making the code more understandable.

### Swift Computed Properties:
Application of Swift computed properties was applied, enhancing dynamic data processing capabilities.

### Swift Closures and Completion Handlers:
Implementation of Swift closures and completion handlers for managing asynchronous operations was applied, making the application faster and more responsive.

### URLSession for Network Requests:
The use of URLSession for retrieving data from the internet was applied, integrating live data into the application.

### JSON Parsing with Encodable and Decodable:
Implementation of JSON data processing using the Encodable and Decodable protocols in Swift was applied.

### Grand Central Dispatch (GCD):
Application of GCD for improved data fetching on the main thread was applied, resulting in smoother performance.

### Core Location for GPS Data:
The ability to access GPS data using Core Location was applied, enabling location-based weather updates.
